    <h1>A random passage about programming</h1>
    <p1>Programming languages are used by programmers all over the world for doing 
        programming,developing such as: <b>Web development,App development,Game
        development etc.</b>Programmers also use programming languages for programming
        contests. With that, they can grow their problem solving skill. Its really
        important for Computer science students to understand how logic &
        algorithm works in a programm. That's Why they learn <b>Data Structure &
        algorithm.</b>Basically by learning Data Structure,they can dive deeper
        into the programming world and they can enrich their programming 
        fundamental things. Programming is like math. The more you practice,the
        more you can become an expert. Those students who loves to code and who does
        code on regular basis has a strong knowledge in programming. Its exactly
        like doing maths. Either you find interest in it,or leave it by saying <b>
        It can't be done by me!I'm not good enough.</b> The most important thing is 
        practicing it regularly.I'm writing this paragraph by using html which is 
        not a programming language. The full meaning of html is hypertext markup 
        language. HTML is like bones of a website.By using css alongside html,
        we can design our webpage. But at first,we have to learn html perfectly
        so that we can make bones of our webpage more stronger.
        
      There are some programming languages such as:
        <ol type="1">
        <b> <li>C</li>
            <li>C++</li>
            <li>C#</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Ruby</li>
            <li>Dart</li>
            <li>Algol</li>
            <li>Rust</li> </b>
        </ol>
        </p1>
       <p2> These are the some examples of programming languages. Some of them are 
        object oriented and some of them are structured. Object oriented languages
        gives us extra benefits like class etc. My suggestion to a new programmer
        will be : <b>Learn C and C++ first</b>. C is basically a bit difficult 
        but by learning C hardly , you can master other languages as well.
